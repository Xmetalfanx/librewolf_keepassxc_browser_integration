# LibreWolf KeepassXC Integration Helper

## Goal

This is just a helper script that I may eventually add to my LinuxSetup project, that helps with an "issue" with [KeepassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc) Integration with [Librewolf](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/appimage)

Question: this is what the official LibreWolf page links to but is this (repo/link) for the appimage build only? ... anyway it's linked to by the Librewolf page
